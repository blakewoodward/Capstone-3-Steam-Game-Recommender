# Capstone-3-Steam-Game-Recommender

For this project I created a video game recommender system using steam play hour data collected from the SteamWorks API (https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api) and item feature data collected from the SteamSpy API (https://steamspy.com/).

The final model is a user based collabortive filtering model using the LightFM library. A full project report can be found in the reports folder.
